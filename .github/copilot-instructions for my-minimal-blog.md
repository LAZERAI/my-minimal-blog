Conventions & patterns

Debugging notes

What NOT to change without discussion

Examples you can modify directly

```html
<section class="post-card">
  <h2><a href="/">New Post Title</a></h2>
  <p class="date">YYYY-MM-DD</p>
  <p>Post summary...</p>
</section>
```

If anything above is unclear or you'd like me to include more examples (e.g., small CSS token edits or a sample lint/check script), tell me which part to expand and I'll iterate.
